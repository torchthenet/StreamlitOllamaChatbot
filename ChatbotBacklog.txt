BUG-004: Copy/Paste into prompt
Created: 11/11/2024
Closed : <OPEN>
During demo to Lois, tailoring follow-on prompt, replaced prompt with text, then change focus to prior question to copy/paste some context, then back to prompt field and earlier changes are lost. Even with ctrl-enter the changes are not persisting. Not sure if this is how Streamlit text entry field should work or if code needs to change.
