= = = = = BUGS

BUG-001: Debug view model
Created: 7:29 PM 10/29/2024
Closed : 3:58 AM 10/31/2024
In ChatbotPages, debug view, view model is broken.
Only shows first chat, can't select other 4.
Solution - show all 5 instead of requiring user to select.

BUG-002: Reselect model on page change
Created: 7:29 PM 10/29/2024
Closed : 4:00 AM 10/31/2024
In ChatbotPages, user must reselect desired model for the page after viewing another page.

BUG-003: Lose system prompt on page change
Created: 11/11/2024
Closed : 5/3/2025
During demo to Lois, tailored system prompt did not persist after page change.
Solution - fixed with major refactor of Chatbot and ChatbotPages

BUG-004: Copy/Paste into prompt
Created: 11/11/2024
Closed : 5/3/2025
During demo to Lois, tailoring follow-on prompt, replaced prompt with text, then change focus to prior question to copy/paste some context, then back to prompt field and earlier changes are lost.
Even with ctrl-enter the changes are not persisting. Not sure if this is how Streamlit text entry field should work or if code needs to change.
Solution - fixed with major refactor of Chatbot and ChatbotPages

BUG-005: 
Created: 1/15/2025
Closed : 1/15/2025
The batch files to run each bot are specific to Anaconda. The i13 laptop uses the default Python installer.
Created a virtual environment in StreamlitExamples then edited the batch files to activate that.

BUG-006: Ollama library changed
Created: 1/15/2025
Closed : 1/15/2025
In Chatbot, ChatbotTabs, and ChatbotPages, a keyerror exception is raised at the line:
    model_list.append(m['name'])
Turns out, the dictionary returned by ollama.list() no longer has 'name' and instead uses 'model'.
Fixed by s/'name'/'model'/.

FEATURE-001: Save chat
Created: 7:30 PM 10/29/2024
Closed : 4/19/2025
In Chatbot, ChatbotTabs, ChatbotPages, the user should be able to save the chat to a text file.
Initial version saves the full prompt, response, and metrics list every time a prompt is submitted.
A future version may improve this by appending instead of overwriting. But it's easy to use
json.dump and json.load to save and restore the lists. Appending is more complicated.

FEATURE-002: Monitor token use
Created: 7:32 PM 10/29/2024
Closed : 4/19/2025
In Chatbot, ChatbotTabs, ChatbotPages, the user should be able to see how many context tokens have been used and how many remain in the current context window.
Need to interrogate active model to determine context size currently configured.
Added startup method that inventories models and saves max context size. This is used to set the context token slider max.

FEATURE-003: Set num_ctx
Created: 4/18/2025
Closed: 4/19/2025
In Chatbot, ChatbotTabs, ChatbotPages, the user should be able to set num_ctx using a slider or text entry field.
The slider or text field should be set to the current value so the user is aware.
Initial version does not check what the max context size of the model is. User may set to more than the model supports.

FEATURE-004: Include temperature in metrics
Created: 4/19/2025
Closed: 4/19/2025
In Chatbot, ChatbotTabs, ChatbotPages, the user should see the temperature setting in the metrics for each response.
The temperature is not part of each metrics entry in the list, and is displayed to the user for each response.

FEATURE-005: Include system prompt in metrics
Created: 4/19/2025
Closed: 4/19/2025
In Chatbot, ChatbotTabs, ChatbotPages, the user may change the system prompt with every response.
To support troubleshooting, or understand responses, the current system prompt should be saved along with other metrics.

FEATURE-006: Add copy to clipboard to outputs and prompts
Created: 4/20/2025
Closed: 4/20/2025
In Chatbot, ChatbotTabs, ChatbotPages, the user should be able to copy their prior prompts or any responses to the clipboard.
Solution is to replace st.write with st.code(<<<text>>>, language=None, wrap_lines=True)

FEATURE-007: Use the system message included in the model
Created: 4/20/2025
Closed: 4/20/2025
In Chatbot, ChatbotTabs, ChatbotPages, any model default system message should be included in st.session_state['cb_system'].
Solution is to add a callback so that when the user changes the model, cb_system is deleted.
Then change SetSystemMessage() to check cb_models for a system_model.

FEATURE-008: Utility to recover data from logs
Created: 4/20/2025
Closed: <OPEN>
The logs created by FEATURE-001 are json dumps. While the text file can be viewed, it's very hard to read.
It's not possible to copy and paste from the log file into a prompt.
A utility is needed (maybe in DataWrangler?) to parse these files into something usable.
